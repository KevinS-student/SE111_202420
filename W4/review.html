        <p>   If you don't know much about spongebob this will problably make no sense but during a fight over the seceret formula Spongbob, Patrick and Mr. Krabs try to fight off plankton but during their fight the formula goes missing plunging Bikini Bottom into chaos. this causes spongebob and plankton to team up to search for the formula they end up making a machine that can travel through space and time in order to look for the formula. this however does not work and the resedents of Bikini Bottom decide to sacrifice spongebob however before they follow through spongebob smells kraby patties causing everyone to follow him where he leads the city to the surface where the residents of Bikini Bottom decide to turn back except for the main cast. though as Squidward decides to finally turn back Bubbles arrives. Bubbles is a dolphin and also the protector of the galaxy until Spongbob and Plankton got him fired by accident.  </p>
        
        <p>   As Spongebob pleads for his and his freinds lives Bubbles reveals that he actually came to thank him for helping him get out of his dead end job and gives them the ability to breath air and launches them to the surface. after the gang continue their mission to retrieve the seceret formula finding a pirate ship with wheels acting as a food truck giving out Krabby Patties. and upon futher investigation they find a pirate named Burger Beard who has the formula. And when confronted reveals a magic book that makes whatever is written in it true. then he shows them this by sending them to a rock at sea surrounded by seagulls who want to eat the gang. But thanks to Spongbobs quick thinking he tore a piece of the books paper and took a feather from one of the swooping seagulls and dipping it in ink that squidward was so generous to donate. He sends the gang back to the food truck as superheros. Where they then fight Burger Beard and try to take back the formula. </p>
